      <p>The <a href="http://portal.getty.edu/">Getty Research Portal</a>, an initiative of the Getty Research
      Institute, is a free online search platform providing access to an extensive collection of digitized art
      history texts from a range of art libraries and museums around the world. Begun in 2012, in
      collaboration with eight international institutions, the Portal is a multilingual and multicultural
      union catalog that affords art historians and other researchers the ability to search and download
      complete digital copies of publications devoted to art, architecture, material culture, and related
      fields. With more than thirty contributing institutions and access to more than 140,000 volumes at
      present, the project continues to expand its virtual holdings. The Portal also facilitates participation
      in various database, bibliographic, and digital art history projects such the Digital Cicognara Library.
      The volumes of the Cicognara Library can be seen within the larger art historical context of the
      Portalâ€™s expanding collection, which has grown to include not only the foundational literature of
      western art history but more recently to assemble digitized art historical texts from contributors in
      Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America as well.</p>
